                    <h3>Classic massage 60 min<br>109,29 €</h3>
                    <p>We can do a full or half body massage depending on whether you want to focus on something specific. You also decide whether we should do a more in-depth treatment or a stress-reducing and more relaxing massage.</p>

                    <h3>Cup treatment 90 min<br>145,90 €</h3>
                    <p>These soft cups are pressed together and then form a vacuum that lifts the skin. This improves blood circulation, stimulates the lymphatic system and the cleansing of waste products, massages the connective tissue and gives smoother and softer skin. We use static cups (stationary), dynamic (moving cups) and a smaller face cup.</p>

                    <h3>Pregnancy massage 90 min<br>145,90 €</h3>
                    <p>In this 90 min pregnancy treatment, you get a full body massage including foot massage and head massage. Being pregnant puts more strain on the body than usual, which can often cause pain around the pelvis, shoulders and feet. I always adapt the treatment to your needs and wishes, we can treat specific complaints or do a classic pregnancy massage just because it feels good.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>If you have pregnancy-related problems such as oedema, swelling or restless legs, this 90-minute treatment is preferable as we do a lymphatic massage to improve and prevent swelling in particular. With a lymphatic massage, you also get a self-care program how you can treat yourself at home alone or together with a partner.</p>

                    <h3>Lymph massage  90 min<br>145,90 €</h3>
                    <p>The lymphatic system is the body's sewer and purification system. It flushes out debris and harmful substances in our bodies, transports around immune cells and maintains our important fluid balance.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>When the lymphatic system flows properly, we also feel good, it makes us feel light, mobile and energetic. When the lymphatic system is sluggish and congested instead, we can feel lethargic, heavy and tired. In a lymphatic massage, we work with slow and firm grips in the direction of the lymph as well as loosening grips to facilitate and improve the flow of the lymph.</p>
